# About

![Alexandra standing in the middle of downtown Athens, GA. She is wearing a black top, jeans, black boots, and glasses.|right](assets/headshot-bw.png "Alexandra in Athens, GA") Alexandra teaches in the English department at Texas Christian University. Her research focuses on the intersections of literature, film, and other media in the early 20th century, with a special interest in the historical recovery of neglected women writers.

Her first book, [*Before Fanfiction: Recovering the Literary History of American Media Fandom*](https://beforefanfiction.com), was released by LSU Press in October 2023.

Alexandraâ€™s current project, [*Hollywood Regionalism*](http://hollywoodregionalism.com), investigates how the studio system adapted, revised, and transformed dozens of regional novels by American women writers from 1910-1961. She and her students have researched hundreds of these film adaptations, many lost or forgotten, and are working to bring them back into public view.

In 2024, Alexandra's photo essay "[A Walk Through Weelaunee Forest](https://www.thexylom.com/post/perspective-a-walk-through-weelaunee-forest)," was a finalist for an Atlanta Press Club Award. The essay explores the natural and political history of the forest slated to become "Cop City" in Dekalb County, Georgia. 

Alexandra previously [co-hosted a podcast about college and coronavirus](https://anchor.fm/residential-spread), wrote a [poetry chapbook about Godzilla](https://nonmodernist.itch.io/call-of-the-monsters), taught a [course on anarchist nonfiction](/docs/courses/anarchist-nonfiction-across-genres/), and won two Primetime Emmys for her work as a transmedia producer creating interactive storytelling experiences.
